          Vision: To facilitate the needs of two sets of people. The one who
          need the help and care(Client) and the other set comprises of people
          who take care(Caretaker) and earn some extra money/earning.<br></br>{" "}
          The client could include busy parents of young children or busy
          children of older parents who despite wanting to may not find time to
          get involved with activities with these people on a day-to-day basis.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          This to address the needs of children and old people as well as many
          differently abled people. The task may be; make him do the homework or
          take the child to playground and maybe play a game of badminton. In
          case of old people, it may be simply for the sake of company or just
          accompany them to a mall or movie or hospital, for regular check up
          etc.{" "}
          <span className="font-medium underline underline-offset-2">
            There is a major gap as all this cannot be left to the helper while
            the close relatives are busy in their professional responsibilities.
          </span>
          <br></br>
          <br></br> A professional or someone who stays abroad is often too busy
          to spend quality time with their elderly. They look for help to take
          care for his/her multi-tasking needs.{" "}
          <span className="font-medium underline underline-offset-2">
            They are Help-Seekers. We call them Client.
          </span>{" "}
          As a help seeker, it is comforting that some responsible care-taker is
          around who can ensure that their child is picked up from creche at
          right time and is fed, involved in activities (like a game of
          badminton or painting at home), dropped-off and picked up from classes
          and helped with homework, etc.<br></br>
          <br></br> On the other hand, there are other set of people like
          students looking for pocket money or few retired people/lady teachers
          or educated housewives who can spare some time and will be happy to
          earn some extra money.{" "}
          <span className="font-medium underline underline-offset-2">
            They are care takers.
          </span>
          <br></br>
          <br></br> To bridge these gaps, to connect the right Help Seeker and
          the appropriate CareTakers, there is a need to develop an
          e-marketplace application(Both android and iOS) where both can
          register themselves and their profiles are visible to other party and
          a suitable match is made. This app aims at giving the suitable
          platform to these set of people who can interact with each-other with
          a level of assurance of their suitability for their job and then agree
          to the needs and the services.<br></br>
          <br></br> Carenearn(Care and earn) will be the platform where the two
          kinds of needs are mapped and both the parties reap benefit.<br></br>
          <br></br> The admin will ensure that the information given by all the
          people who register is validated through a level of checks and
          documentations.
